# AptoPilot ✈️  
**DeFi Autopilot on Aptos — From One Sentence to Fully Executed Strategy**

AptoPilot lets you type *one* sentence and get a **live, self-optimizing DeFi strategy on Aptos**.  
No forms. No endless toggles. No gas anxiety. Just **goal → strategy → execution**.

> _“Move 40% of my USDC into safe yield on Aptos.  
> If ETH borrow rates drop below 4%, open a position.  
> Exit everything if my risk score spikes.”_

AptoPilot reads that, builds the flow, and **actually executes it** on Aptos and connected ecosystems.

## 🌌 Why Aptos?

We’re not just “also on Aptos”. We’re **built for Aptos**.

AptoPilot treats **Aptos as the strategy brain**:

- 🧱 **Move safety** – Strategies are encoded in Move modules, with resource safety and predictable behavior.
- ⚡ **Fast finality & high throughput** – Great UX for reactive strategies that rebalance, exit, and re-route quickly.
- 🔀 **Parallel execution** – Perfect for complex DAG-style flows where multiple actions can be processed efficiently.
- 🧪 **Devnet / testnet friendly** – Easy to prototype new DeFi “flight plans” and plug into ecosystem protocols.

Aptos is where **intents become programmable, safe, and composable** — so AptoPilot lives here.

## ✨ What AptoPilot Does

Most “AI intent” tools stop at:

> “Swap token A for token B.”

Cool demo. Not a real co-pilot.

**AptoPilot goes deeper** and focuses on the *hard* parts of DeFi:

- 🏦 **Lending strategies** – Supply assets, manage health factors, set exits.
- 🧬 **Borrow loops & leverage** – Borrow, re-supply, and unwind on conditions.
- 🌾 **Yield strategies** – Allocate across vaults / pools, rebalance on APY & risk.
- 🚨 **Risk-aware exits** – Auto-unwind when conditions break (risk score, HF, volatility).

All of this is expressed by the user in plain language and executed through an **Aptos-native strategy engine**.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> **You tell AptoPilot what you want.  
> AptoPilot figures out where, how, and when — on Aptos and beyond.**

Instead of:
- Clicking through 8 screens  
- Manually calculating APYs  
- Watching charts all day  

You describe:
- **Goal** – “Safe yield”, “aggressive but capped downside”, “ETH accumulation”, etc.  
- **Constraints** – Max borrow %, max slippage, risk comfort, chains allowed.  
- **Exit rules** – “Exit if APY drops by 50%”, “if protocol risk score spikes”, etc.

AptoPilot turns this into:
1. A **strategy spec**
2. A **DAG of on-/off-chain actions**
3. A **live strategy** that executes and self-adjusts.

## 🎯 Example Intents

```text
“Allocate 30% of my USDC to the safest yield on Aptos.
If something better appears with +2% APY and similar risk, move there.”

“Borrow ETH on Aptos only if the borrow rate is under 3.5%.
Exit the position if my health factor goes below 1.5.”

“Park my stablecoins in low-risk yield across Aptos protocols,
rebalance weekly, and keep at least 20% liquid at all times.”
